2011/08/08 T.S.:
 - rtems-bsp-postlink.m4: modified 'qemuprep' pattern (-> 'qemuprep*')
   so that variants of the BSP are accepted.
2011/07/15 T.S.:
 - rtems-bsp-postlink.m4: added 'qemuprep' bsp.
2011/07/15 T.S.:
 - rtems-setup-recurse.m4: propagate 'rtems_bsp' variable on command line when configuring
   in BSP subdir (rtems_bsp=$rtems_bsp).
2010/06/30 T.S.:
 - rtems-bsp-class.m4, rtems-setup-recurse.m4: Added RTEMS_BSP_CLASS which
   essentially replaces RTEMS_BSP_FAMILY (gone with 4.10). The concept is 
   still useful when we have to support features that are shared by a group
   of BSPs.
2010/06/15 T.S.:
 - rtems-tools.m4. Reset OPTIND=1 after 'shift'. Older bash doesn't do so
   by itself!
2010/06/11 T.S.:
 - ChangeLog: added.
 - multilib-fix.m4:       BUGFIX.
     pass CXX, F77, GCJ, GFORTRAN in addition to CC to sub-configure.
 - rtems-bsp-postlink.m4: BUGFIX.
     'motorola_powerpc' RTEMS_BSP_FAMILY doesn't work anymore (deprecated).
     Hence, use BSP name (mcp750, mtx603e, mvme2100, mvme2307) as a discriminator
     for RTEMS_BSP_POSTLINK_CMDS.
 - rtems-isrtems.m4:
     Added test for either --with-rtems-top not given OR --host=*rtems* given
     (i.e., we are NOT at the top of a recursive configuration process).
 - rtems-options.m4:
     Base default 'package_subdir' on new SUPERPACKAGE_NAME rather than PACKAGE_NAME.
     Introduced new AC_ARG_VAR SUPERPACKAGE_NAME which is also passed in the 
     environment to sub-configures so that all sub-packages are installed to
     the same 'package_subdir'.
 - rtems-setup-recurse.m4:
     o Use new TILLAC_RTEMS_NOT_CONFIG_TOP macro instead of explicit test.
     o BUGFIX: need to set ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS=-I./m4 in created makefile.top.am
       so that maintainer-mode works as expected.
 - rtems-tools.m4:
     o Omit check for tools if we are at the top of a recursive configuration
       (here, the check looks for *native* tools which may not be present!).
       Added a horrible hack for CC/CXX since AC_PROG_CC, AC_PROG_CXX must
       not be conditionally expanded. Instead, if we are at a config-top we
       use a hacked shell script that just gets us around the (native) CC/GXX test.
